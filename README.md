This is the official codebase for the paper **EMatch: A Unified Framework for Event-based Optical Flow and Stereo Matching (ICCV 2025)**.

## 💥 News

- **[2025.11.15]** ✨ The checkpoints have been organized and published.

- **[2025.07.03]** 🚀 We released the traning and evaluation code.

- **[2025.06.24]** 🎉 EMatch is accepted by ICCV 2025.

## 👀 Introduction

EMatch is a unified framework applicable to both optical flow and stereo matching for event cameras. We reformulate these two tasks as a pixel-wise correspondence matching problem and design a novel unified framework to solve them within a shared representation space. Our unified framework supports both separate training of single-task models for optical flow and disparity, and joint training of a multi-task model — each method achieves optimal performance.

## 🛠️ Denpendency

You can install `anaconda` and configure the virtual environment.

The following is a feasible version configuration:

- python = 3.8
- pytorch = 2.0.0
- CUDA = 11.7 (NVIDIA-SMI = 515.76)
  
You can refer to the following installation steps:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

    ```
    conda create -n ematch python=3.8
    conda activate ematch
    ```

2. Install Pytorch and CUDA.

    ```
    conda install pip
    pip install torch==2.0.0 torchvision==0.15.1 torchaudio==2.0.1
    ```

    You can find the installation instructions on the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/).

3. Install the necessary python libraries.
   
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🤖️ Checkpoints

### Manually
You can download all checkpoints here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1geAMTtWiySkU17SbWa3PH4mkSCinCEk6?usp=sharing) / [BaiduDisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yPLWfswXg9jqxNoWzkrkLw?pwd=pjir)

### Run Script (gdown python package required)
```
sh ./script/download_checkpoints.sh
```

## 📁 Datasets

### Manually
Please download the [DSEC](https://dsec.ifi.uzh.ch/) and [MVSEC](https://daniilidis-group.github.io/mvsec/) datasets. 

Details about the datasets can be found in the [data/README.md](./data/README.md) file.

### Run Script (gdown python package required)

#### MVSEC
```
sh ./script/download_mvsec_indoor_flying.sh
```

#### EVB_CIRS
```
sh ./script/download_cirs_dataset.sh
```

## 📈 Training and Evaluation

### Training and Testing with MVSEC and DSEC datasets

All training and evaluation scripts are provided in the `/scripts` directory. 

For example, you can run the `.sh` files directly from the command line to obtain results of EMatch:

```
sh ./scripts/test/unified/dsec_ematch_flow.py
sh ./scripts/test/unified/dsec_ematch_disparity.py
sh ./scripts/test/unified/mvsec_ematch_flow.py
sh ./scripts/test/unified/mvsec_ematch_disparity.py
```

You can run the following `.sh` files to train EMatch:

```
sh ./scripts/train/unified/dsec_ematch_stage1.sh
sh ./scripts/train/unified/dsec_ematch_stage2.sh
sh ./scripts/train/unified/mvsec_ematch.sh
```

### Testing with EVB_CIRS dataset
```
sh ./scripts/evb_cirs/test_evb_cirs.sh
```

More scripts are available in the `/scripts` directory. If you wish to conduct further experiments, you may customize the provided `.sh` files to fit your specific requirements.
